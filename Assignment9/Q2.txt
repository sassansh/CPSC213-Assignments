aRead is able to perform multiple reads in parallel, therefore its performance is significantly
improved compared to sRead. Because of this, increasing the number of reads doesnt affect the 
amount of time it takes aRead to run as they all happen at the same time. 

On the other hand, sRead's speed is proportional to the number of reads it is doing as each read 
has its own delay.
