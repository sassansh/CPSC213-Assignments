The issue arises in the list.c file on lines 62 and 63 where:

  free (element_get_value (e));
  free (e);

  are called. These lines of code are not aware of the refrences to those elements by the tree. 
  So once we free those elements, they are no longer in memory. So when we ask the tree to print its
  values, it does cannot access it anymore.
